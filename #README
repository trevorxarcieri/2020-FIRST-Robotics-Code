This is the code for the robot Team 3667 created for the 2020 season of FIRST Robotics, Infinite Recharge, in the early weeks of 2020.
I, Trevor Arcieri, was the informal lead programmer on the team. I lead the programming efforts of our robotics team that year,
despite it being my rookie year. In fact, I wrote all of the Java code contained here except for the Main.java file which is open source
and provided to the team through the FIRST Robotics Competition, and the 54 lines of targeting code (lines 98-116, 218-221, and 708-738)
in the Operations.java file, which my teammate Lawrence "Chet" Skotzke wrote. I wrote the code as a high school junior over the span of 
three months, during my first approximately five months on the team, only having access to the physical robot for testing purposes during 
the final three weeks of this time. During these three months, I worked approximately 13 hours per week on this code. The code operates 
our 2020 Alpha robot sufficiently, but currently does not contain programming for the autonomous section of the competition. In fact, 
much of the code is rather messy, since our season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of the code is commented-out: 
these are portions we were preparing to make functional in the robot, but did not have time to polish before our first competition. 
The code could easily be tidied up and would still allow our robot to function extremely well, as it did at competition. I like to 
preserve the code as it was when the season ended as a sort of time capsule of my past coding forays.
